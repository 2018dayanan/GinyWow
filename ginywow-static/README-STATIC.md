# GinyWow - Static Version (Shared Hosting)

## 📁 What's Included

This is the **frontend-only** version of GinyWow for shared hosting.

- `index.html` - Main HTML file
- `assets/` - CSS, JavaScript, and images
- `.htaccess` - Apache configuration for React routing

## ⚠️ Important Note

**This version DOES NOT include:**
- URL shortening functionality 
- Contact form backend
- Database features
- API endpoints

The frontend will load but backend features won't work.

## 🚀 Shared Hosting Deployment

### Step 1: Upload Files
1. Login to your **Hostinger Control Panel**
2. Go to **File Manager** 
3. Navigate to `public_html` folder
4. Upload ALL files from this folder **directly** into `public_html/`

### Step 2: File Structure Should Be:
```
public_html/
├── index.html
├── .htaccess
└── assets/
    ├── favicon-DamKdKQ8.png
    ├── index-1KPY6H9T.css
    └── index-DoKhTRfL.js
```

### Step 3: Test
Visit your domain - the website should load!

## ✅ What Works in Static Version:
- Homepage design and layout
- All page navigation
- Responsive design
- Basic UI interactions

## ❌ What Doesn't Work:
- URL generation (Generate button won't work)
- Contact form submission
- Any backend API calls

## 💡 Recommendation
For full functionality, use the **VPS deployment** with `ginywow-fullstack-production.tar.gz` instead.
